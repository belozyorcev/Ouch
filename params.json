It's not an exact port of\r\nWhoops, but implements similar functionality and uses same front end resources in some of its error handlers. It is an\r\nerror handler base/framework for NodeJs. Out-of-the-box, it provides a pretty error interface that helps you debug your\r\nweb projects, but at heart it's a simple yet powerful stacked error handling system.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\n- [Blue theme](https://quorrajs.github.io/Ouch/demo/)\r\n- [Orange theme](https://quorrajs.github.io/Ouch/demo/orange.html)\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Detailed & intuitive page for errors and exceptions (PrettyPageHandler)\r\n- Code view for all frames in a stack trace with line highlights (PrettyPageHandler)\r\n- Frame comments & analysis through custom middle-ware/handlers (PrettyPageHandler)\r\n- Request & app-specific information through custom middle-ware/handlers (PrettyPageHandler)\r\n- Clean and tested code-base that's easy to extend and build on to make it work just right for your project\r\n\r\n## Learn More & Contribute\r\n\r\nAPI Documentation is available [here](http://ouch.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).
